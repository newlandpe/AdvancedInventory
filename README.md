# AdvancedInventory Plugin

## Project Development Progress: Inventory Separation Module

ðŸ§± Development progress on the "Fyennyi Gamemode Survival" project (formerly "NewLand Games") continues unabated. While we occasionally discuss what the project will look like in the future, it's important to report on the progress made and the future prospects of the inventory separation system (AdvancedInventory module).

### Overview

This plugin introduces a crucial mechanic for fair gameplay survival, as we've incorporated the following features:

- When switching game modes to Creative/Spectator, the survival/adventure inventory contents will be saved to the database and only then cleared by setting the content from the previously saved inventory.
- When switching game modes to Survival/Adventure, the contents of the creative inventory (or spectator) will be saved to the database and only then cleared by setting the content from the already saved survival inventory.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Configuration File:** A configuration file has been developed, allowing you to customize the following properties:
   - Full module disablement, if necessary.
   - Separation of main inventory content.
   - Separation of armor inventory area.
   - Separation of offhand.
   - Separation of applied player effects.
   - ðŸ†• Forced clearing of each inventory part, if necessary.
